- All changes in this release come from Greg Oschwalrd.

- Major internals rewrite to speed things up. We no longer wrap NetAddr::IP
  objects (but we do use NetAddr::IP::Util).

- Net::Works::Network->mask_length() now returns the mask as passed to the
  constructor, not the number of bits in the mask. The ->bits method returns
  the number of bits in the mask (32 or 128).

- The Network->netmask_as_integer() method no longer exists (use mask_length()
  instead). The ->max_netmask_as_integer() method has been renamed to
  ->max_mask_length().

- Added Net::Works::Address->mask_length() and ->bits() (which always return
  the same thing).

- We use Socket::inet_ntop to stringify addresses.
